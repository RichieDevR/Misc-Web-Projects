This Repo is to showcase and keep my skills fresh. I'm going to try and upload something to this every day, so if you stumble across this and my last commit badge says anything other than today or yesterday, then you know I'm slacking. I encourage you to send me a wordy email telling me to get it together if that is indeed the case.
